            <p class="blockinfos__txt">It all began with a split! Planet M41/AR was home to the most technologically advanced robot civilization. Robot Nodes and Sentinels working to keep the blockchain online, that was their life force. Overwhelmed with greed and the pursuit of more energy, they spread themselves too thin, allowing for the catastrophic chain split! And explosion that broke their vital energy apart, stripping them from the source that kept them running. This energy became dark with time, and corruption started to occur.</p>
            <p class="blockinfos__txt">That's where the Nightmare began. Horrid creatures started coming to life, emerging from the ground and ashes, corrupting, and destroying everything surrounding them. Nature became corrupted, beasts were getting possessed, and the nodes more unstable. As the Robots start to regain their energy, now they must face the darkness they have created. Which side are you on?</p>
